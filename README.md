# Space_Invaders
Hello everyone, I have made a space invaders game. Space Invaders is a classic arcade-style shooting game where players control a rocket to defend against waves of descending alien ships.

Game Guide
- Open the source file in any IDE like IDLE Shell, VSCode etc
- Run the file
- Use the left and right arrow keys to move the rocket.
- Press the space bar to shoot bullets.
- Destroy all alien ships to proceed to the next level.

Features
- Classic Gameplay: Control a rocket to shoot and destroy alien ships.
- Levels: Advance through levels as you clear all aliens on screen.
- Score Tracking: Keep track of your score and highest level achieved.
- Menu Options: Pause and resume the game, mute/unmute sound, and view high scores.
- High Score: Track your high score and continue from where you left off.
